# Description

When the bot engine receives a message from whatsapp, we use the `WhatsAppReceiveIncomingMsgHandler` to handle all whatsapp messages.

This module contains implementation for:
  - Interpreting the whatsapp message to our standardized message format
  - Interpreting Story Blocks to whatsapp messages
  - Sending whatsapp messages through the whatsapp api endpoint

To test the bot on whatsapp you need to register on the [Meta Developer Platform](https://developers.facebook.com).

## How to setup your Meta Developer Account

If you had registered for a meta developer account, go to step 2
### 1. Create a Meta Developer Account
- Go to [Meta Developer Platform](https://developers.facebook.com) and login with your facebook account
- Click on 'Get Started' in the top right
- Follow the steps shown to create your developer account

### 2. Create an app
- Once you have your developer account head to your [My Apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and click on 'Create App'
- In 'Select an app type' select 'Business' and click next
- Enter the app name e.g. 'Elewa Conversational Learning App' and click 'Create App'. Enter your facebook account password if you are prompted.

### 3. Setup whatsapp
- Once you have your app is created, you will be redirected to the developers dashboard

### 4. Configure webhooks
- Under the whatsapp menu, click 'Quickstart' if you are not there already.
- Click 'Configure Webhooks'.

- The 'Verify token' can be any string of text. Just keep it short. E.g. Elewa CLM Token.

### 5. Test

This will be the phone number of our bot.
