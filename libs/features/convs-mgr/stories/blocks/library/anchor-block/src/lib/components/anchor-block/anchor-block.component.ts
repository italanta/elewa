 * Therefore we need a block that will act as the first block in the story and help us save the
 *  connection to the first block.
 * 
 * So the Anchor Block @Component {AnchorBlockComponent} is a static component that is automatically added to the story editor 
 * @see {StoryEditorFrame} new story is created. It is the 'anchor' point to the rest of the story.
 * 
 * We will just save the first connection whose id == storyId. In this way, we will be able to get the
 *  first connection and send it back to the end user.
