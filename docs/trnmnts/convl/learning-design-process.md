## The Case for Conversational Learning Tools

Every properly designed application starts from a "**Purpose**". A "Why", a "Raison d'Ãªtre"/"Reason of being", a "Meaning", ...

*In an economy we generate value for ourselves by offering- and generating value to others. As a developer, it's therefore crucial to understand this "Purpose" as it captures the problem you're solving. By solving a problem for someone, you generate (business) value. In return, your contribution to that business value results in returns.*

The "Elewa Conversational Learning Platform" packs **both an authoring and execution tool for** blended, and/or fully online, **conversational learning programs**. 

The key advantage of Conversational Learning programs over traditional eLearning environments is that of "**accessability**" and "**ease of scale**".
