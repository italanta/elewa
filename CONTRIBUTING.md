# Introduction

### Write something nice here!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to italanta.

[source: [italanta](https://github.com/italanta/italanta-apps/blob/main/docs/contribution.md)] **Need more information about the italanta projects?** [1] [[Read The Docs](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html](https://italanta.github.io/italanta/))]

### Why you should read our contributing guidelines.

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

[source: [italanta](https://github.com/italanta/italanta-apps/blob/main/docs/contribution.md)]

### What kinds of contributions we are looking for.

> italanta is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into italanta itself.

[source: [italanta](https://italanta.github.io/italanta/)]

<!-- ### Contributions we are NOT looking for (if any).

Again, defining this up front means less work for you. If someone ignores your guide and submits something you don’t want, you can simply close it and point to your policy.

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Check whether the #pocoo IRC channel on Freenode can help with your issue. If your problem is not strictly Werkzeug or Flask specific, #python is generally more active. Stack Overflow is also worth considering.

# Ground Rules
<!-- ### Set expectations for behavior (yours, and theirs).
This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc). Mention and link to your code of conduct, if you have one. -->

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: [https://github.com/italanta/italanta-apps/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md](https://github.com/italanta/italanta-apps/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.

# Your First Contribution
<!-- Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues. -->

> Unsure where to begin contributing to italanta? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
> Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
> Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
> Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

<!-- [source: [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#your-first-code-contribution)] **Need more inspiration?** [1] [Read the Docs](http://docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html#contributing-to-development) [2] [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/new-contributors/#first-steps) (scroll down to "Guidelines" as well) -->

### Bonus points: Add a link to a resource for people who have never contributed to open source before.
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://github.com/italanta/italanta/blob/master/docs/contribution.md)
[source: [Submitting a pull request](https://github.com/italanta/italanta/blob/master/docs/contribution.md#submitting-a-pull-request)]  

As a side note, it helps to use newcomer-friendly language throughout the rest of your document. Here are a couple of examples from [italanta docs](https://github.com/italanta/italanta/blob/master/docs/contribution.md):

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:
>
>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
To get started you can go to the [Contribution Documentation](https://github.com/italanta/italanta/blob/master/docs/contribution.md)


<!-- ### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know. -->

> Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
>
>As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

# How to report a bug
<!-- ### Explain security disclosures first! -->
At bare minimum, include this sentence:
> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email XXXX instead.

If you don’t want to use your personal contact information, set up a “security@” email address. Larger projects might have more formal processes for disclosing security, including encrypted communication. (Disclosure: I am not a security expert.)

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to contact@italanta.net
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
> * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> * Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at contact@italanta.net.

### How to file a bug report.
A template already exists when you click on create issue select the [bug report issue template](https://github.com/italanta/italanta-apps/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)

> The issue will template will be auto populated, then you can continue fillling the neccessary details. make sure to answer these five questions:
>
> 1. What version of programming language?
> 2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
As for now only the italanta will create the feature request.
<!-- ### If you have a particular roadmap, goals, or philosophy for development, share it here.
This information will give contributors context before they make suggestions that may not align with the project’s needs.


<!-- ### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why it’s needed and how it might work.

> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Elasticsearch, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
 -->

# Code review process
### Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting that we hold in a weekly youst. The meeting is announced in the weekly status updates that are sent to the dev slack channel list. Notes are posted to the italanta Community community repo.
<!-- and include a link to a YouTube recording of the hangout. -->
> After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.


# Community

> You can chat with the core team on slack. We try to have office hours on Fridays.

## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. 

### <a name="commit-message-format"></a> Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```html
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

> Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!<br/>
  This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various Git tools.

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the auxiliary tools such as release scripts
* **build**: Changes to the dependencies, devDependencies, or build tooling
* **ci**: Changes to our Continuous Integration configuration

##### Scope

The scope could be anything that helps specify the scope (or feature) that is changing.

Examples
- fix(select): 
- docs(menu): 

##### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change: [you can add Git Emojis if you want here](https://gitmoji.dev/)

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no period (.) at the end

##### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

##### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**, **Fixes**, or **Relates to**.

> We highlight Breaking Changes in the ChangeLog. These are as changes that will require
  community users to modify their code after updating to a version that contains this commit.

##### Sample Commit messages
